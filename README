openSUSE.org Search
===================

This is the code that runs search.opensuse.org. The primary layout is in
index.php and the site specific html exists in the *.tmpl.php files.

To build the static html pages run build.sh and rsync the output
directoy to the search.opensuse.org webroot.

Ad Notes
--------
If/when openSUSE becomes a registered non-profit we can turn off the ads:
